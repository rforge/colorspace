Changes in Version 1.1-0

  o Added "sRGB" colorspace.  

    (Existing "RGB" colorspace is linearized "sRGB".)

  o Conversions to and from "HSV" and "HSL" can only occur
    from or to "RGB" or "sRGB" (because both "HSV" and "HSL"
    are relative colorspaces, meaning relative to a particular
    RGB colorspace).  

    (Converting to or from "RGB" gives a different result 
     compared to conversion to or from "sRGB".)

  o All 'gamma' parameters in all R-level functions have been deprecated.

    (The "sRGB" colorspace has implicit gamma.)


Changes in Version 1.0-1

  o "Escaping RGBland" paper is now published Computational
    Statistics & Data Analysis as doi:10.1016/j.csda.2008.11.033.
    Citation and references updated accordingly.
