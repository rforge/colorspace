<h2>App Information</h2>

<p>
The R <code>colorspace</code> package, beside a variety of useful
and user-friendly methods and functions to create effective color palettes,
provides methods to emulate <b>color vision deficiency</b> (CVD) for different types
of visual disorders.
</p>

<p>
This CVD emulator allows everyone to emulate the different deficiencies with different
strengths on raster images (PNG or JPG/JPEG) to identify possible problems with existing
plots and color maps, or to check whether or not new color palettes work for people
with a specific color vision deficiency (e.g., the common red-green blindness).
