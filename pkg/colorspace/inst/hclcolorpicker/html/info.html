<h2>Shiny App to Pick Colors in HCL Space</h2>
<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The app visualizes colors either along the hue-chroma plane for a given luminance value or along the
luminance-chroma plane for a given hue. Colors can be entered by specifying the hue (H), chroma (C),
and luminance (L) values via sliders, by entering an RGB hex code, or by clicking on a color in the
hue-chroma or luminance-chroma plane. It is also possible to select individual colors and add them
to a palette for comparison and future reference.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>hclcolorpicker</code> invisibly returns a vector of colors choosen.
If no colors have been selected <code>NULL</code> will be returned.
