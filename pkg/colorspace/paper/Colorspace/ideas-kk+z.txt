What a statistician might want to know about human color vision
but was afraid to ask!


1 Physical and psychological basics/background

1.1 Trichromacy

1.2 Coding vs. perception


2 Color generation and control

2.1 Hardware
- screen, projector, paper
- additive vs. subtractive color
- "completeness" vs. "uniqueness": instead of generating all real colors,
  focus on a (large) set of colors that can be uniquely generated
-> mix three (or four) primaries

2.2 Color spaces/models
- (s)RGB, HSV - CIE, LAB/LUV
- add physical spaces? (LMS?)
- discuss which model can be used to answer which question
- distance, appearance, context

2.3 Software


3 Application/illustrations/case studies

3.1 Scatterplots

- visualization of groups/clusters:
emphasize one (or a few) group(s) -> salience/pop-out
show where they are -> segmentation/segregation

- coupling of colors with symbol forms and sizes?

- use borders around solid symbols or not?

- choice of background color
might reduce luminance contrasts
potentially compensate by increasing other contrasts (e.g., chroma)

3.2 Heatmaps

- why not the rainbow palette?
because the qualitative changes in the color would be used to
depict (smooth) quantitative changes in the data

- contrasts/pop-out?
separate small interesting areas vs. showing overall surfaces

- discrimination of small vs. large differences

- contextual effects?
