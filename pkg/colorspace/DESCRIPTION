Description: Carries out mapping between assorted color spaces including
             RGB, HSV, HLS, CIEXYZ, CIELUV, HCL (polar CIELUV),
	     CIELAB and polar CIELAB. Qualitative, sequential, and
	     diverging color palettes based on HCL colors are provided
	     along with an interactive palette picker (with either a Tcl/Tk
	     or a shiny GUI). Corresponding color scales for ggplot2.
	     Various transformations are provided: desaturation,
	     lightening/darkening, and simulation of color vision deficiencies
	     (deutanomaly, protanomaly, tritanomaly).
